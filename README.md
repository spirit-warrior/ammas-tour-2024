<summary><b>Lifting Columns & System - Specs</b></summary>

---

- Lifting columns model number - DHLCE-270A
- Estimated weight of entire lifting system - 30 lb
- Minimum height - 10.83 in (275 mm) / (10 27/32 in) / (10 13/16 in)
- Maximum height - 19.69 in (500 mm) conflicting info 21.65 in (550 mm)
- Stroke - 10.83 in
- Width of column - 5.67 in / 144 mm / (5 11/16 in)
- Width of column base plate - 7.87 in / 200 mm / (7 7/8 in)
- Thickness of column base plate - 10 mm / 3/8 in
- Load (one leg) - 264.55 lb (120 kg)
- Load (four legs) - 1058.22 lb (480 kg)
- Maximum load - 1200 N
  - N (newton) is a unit of the force needed to accelerate a given mass
- Speed
  - 5 mm per second, 1 inch in 5 seconds
  - 55 seconds to fully extend
  - 40 seconds to lift from 12" to 20"
- Multiple ways to adjust the height
  - Wired switch - in a protected location, where you can use it by feel
  - Remote control - Four remotes for each lifting system
  - Using wifi and smartphone app (maybe)
- Control panel aka controller

  - the up/down arrows are for setting height limits, etc
  - may allow adjusting height (raise and lower)
  - the display tells how far the columns are currently extended
  - protect from damage and tampering

- Momentary contact switches
  - The most intuitive switch is a wired momentary contact switch which only moves while you press and hold the switch. DIHOOL sells a rocker switch (without a cord or case) but it might not be a momentary contact switch. Fortunately, we can buy momentary contact switches and wire them ourselves
  - Ideally this switch should be in a small box.

#### Installation

- Install the lifting columns so that the electrical connections are at the top, under the platform, rather than near the base. The columns can be installed with either side up.
- Attach the controller, power supply and control panel. Most of it just plugs together. A few wires require screwing to a screw terminal.
- Plug it to 120 volts and it should work.
- Best to connect all the components and test them before fastening down the wires
- Then decide the best location for everything

- Location of control panel - TBD

  - display should be visible from somewhere so a specific height can be set

- Optional - Extra rocker switches that Paul is mounting on a panel or in a box
- No loose wires

  - Use wire tie downs
  - Don't use staples because they can cut the wires
  - Don't pull the wires tightly

- Take a couple of days to attach the lifting columns and get to know them
- The remote controls need to be paired with the controllers
- Be ready to repair this stuff
- We have a spare column and controller
- Main risk is physical damage, such as wires getting snagged
- Use crimp-on lugs to attach power supply wires to screw terminals
  - That makes a better connection than wrapping wires around the screws
  - Prevents a stray strand from shorting out.
  - Buy at Home Depot
  - Vise grips are preferred for crimping, don't buy a crimp tool
- Connecting the wired switch
  - looks like you insert the wire and screw down
  - If you have to wrap the wire around the screw, use crimp-on lugs as well
- We have several controllers
  - Controllers to implement tilting
    - "front leg controller" - controls two legs
    - "back leg controller" - controls two legs
  - Controller that is set up to control four legs. For most reliable synchronization of legs, use this controller
- Verify that the controller remembers where the columns are when it loses power. If not, we need a UPS battery backup.

#### Instruction Manual PDF

- See pages 7, 8 and 9 where they tell how to pair the remote controls and attach the power supply and the remote wired switches
- Read about Reset procedure in case of disconnection, pinching, or other problem - page 17

#### Programmable Settings

- For peetham and chair
  - Set lower height limit equal to lowest position - 10.83 in
- Set stroke length (less than 10.83 in)
  - Effectively sets maximum height
  - for chair - ??
  - for peetham - ??
- For help with Error Codes - WeChat 8615669851253 for video calls

- Thickness of plywood base - 0.75 in
- Thickness of top platform (not including padding) - TBD
- Total height to surface of structure - (not including padding)

  - Adjustable from 15 7/8 inches to 23 inches (Paul's numbers? 380 mm and 560 mm)

- Amma's chair and peetham use the same lifting columns
  - DHLCE-270A

#### Switches, buttons, and controls

- Amma's wired switches
  - "Raise" button & "Lower" button
  - must be easy to use, simple and intuitive
  - Location must be -

  - protected from accidental damage
  - visible from some perspective during darshan

#### Modify arm rests for Amma's chair

- Modify chair so that height of arm rest is adjustable
  - allows for manual adjustment
  - as shown in separate section - Amma's Arm Rests in Amritapuri

#### Modify padding on arm rest

- Modify padding on back of the arm rest so that an elastic band can go over the arm rest to hold chair cloth in place

#### Replace the strings that hold the back cushion

- Use strings like the ones on the Michigan chair

#### Notes from Paul Sawyer

- Surface of peetham and chair - 3/4" plywood
- Base of peetham and chair - 3/4" plywood

- New chair would have a plywood seat and a frame that wrapped around the plywood, covering the edge.
- The frame extends below the plywood, providing a hiding place for controller and power supply.
- Mount the lifting columns as close as possible to edge of platform
- Corners of the frame should be miter cut and glued
- No screws are visible
- Round all exposed edges with a router.
- The design should not impede Amma from swinging her feet under the chair.

<summary><b>Amma's Arm Rests in Amritapuri - Notes and Photos
</b></summary>

Under the chair for each armrest, there is a length of square steel tubing which presses against the armrest’s lifting arm and holds it in place.

![image ar1](/images/arm_rests/arm_rest_1.jpg)

---

One side of the tubing has a small square cut out. This is for access for welding a nut inside the tubing.

![image ar2](/images/arm_rests/arm_rest_2.jpg)

---

A machine screw runs through the side of the frame of the chair into the nut in the square tubing. The screw is for tightening the the arm rest extension arms to hold them in desired position. As the extension arm slides up or down so that one of the holes in the extension arm aligns with a round brass pin

<summary><b>Standing Darshan Ramps</b></summary>

---

Warning - These calculations are only valid if stage height is 36 inches

Calculate height of raised platform

- Typical stage height, N. American tour - 36 inches
- Distance of raised platform below stage - 20.75 inches
- 36 - 20.75 = 15.25
- Typical height of raised platform - 15.25 inches

Calculate length of ramp -

- Height of raised platform - 15.25 inches
- Slope - 1:12
- 15.25 x 12 = 183 inches aka 15 feet 3 inches
- Length of ramp - at least 15.25 feet

Virtually all venues in US must comply with ADA requirements (Americans with Disabilities Act). For ADA compliance, the slope for a wheelchair ramp must be no greater than 1:12 (one inch of rise for every 12 inches of ramp length).

Raised platform

- Width - 77 inches
- Front to back - 49.5 inches
- Height - 20.75 inches lower than the stage

Dimensions of ramps

- Width
  - Center ramp - 77 inches
  - Side ramps - 49.5 inches
- Length - 15.25 feet
- Height at high end - 15.25 inches
- Slope - 1:12 or 8.33%

Planks - I don't get this

For standing darshan, there need to be large planks to bring the people higher/closer to Amma as needed

<summary><b>Prasad Table</b></summary>

- Otis is building this table
- 22 inches long x 12 inches wide
- Height
  - Adjustable from 22 to 27 inches
  - can be adjusted during darshan
  - May not need to go as low as 22 inches

An important feature of our prasad table in N. America is that magnets are embedded in the top surface. These magnets hold the prasad tray and sandalwood paste container from sliding around. The magnets can be embedded in the new prasad table after it is built.

Photos of embedded magnets coming (not very) soon!

#### Prasad table side piece

- Hinged and attached at bottom (?)
- Length - 18 inches
- Height - 8 inches

We are requested to have this side piece on the new prasad table. When the side piece is folded out, it "serves as a barrier for the prasad area".

However, I think it isn't helpful for our prasad area. We have never needed it before and it will just be in the way. We won't be able to easily fold it in or out because folding will be blocked by the prasad people sitting on chairs.

About Vertical Side Cushions

- Purpose - to fill the space between the inside of the chair arms
- These cushions should come in sets, one for each side, right?
- Shaped like upside down "L"
  - each vertical side cushion has two pieces, base of "L", and leg of "L", right?
- Length
  - "Not to exceed 8 inches from front of the chair to 2 inches from the back of the chair seat"
  - Adjusted length for US chair - 14 inches per Chaitanyan
- Height of "L" shape
  - unknown
  - "will need to be measured with the seat and back cushions in place".
  - Doesn't height depend on height of arm rests which are supposed to be adjustable?
- Width of "L" shape
  - same as width of arm rest?
  - width of arm rest varies from 8 inches toward the back to 6 inches near the front
  - should width of L shape be tapered?

Vertical Side Cushion A

- Thickness - 1 inch
- Length - 14 inches
- Height - needs to be decided
- Quantity needed - 4? 2? they come in sets, one for each side? Do they want 2 sets, 4 cushions? not clear

Vertical Side Cushion B

- Thickness - 2 inch
- Length - 14 inches
- Height - needs to be decided
- Quantity needed - 2 cushions? or 2 sets? Probably 1 set of 2 cushions, one for each side? not clear

Cushion should be like the one sitting on the arm rest in this image except L-shaped

<summary><b>Mechanical Lifting System - Amritapuri</b></summary>

---

This lifting system was built in India around 2007 by Amma's son Jitendra, using hardware obtained in India.

Amma's chair in Amritapuri also has a similar lifting system but no photos could be provided because the mechanisms are hidden inside the woodwork of the chair.

Image 2 - Sprockets and chain drive. The crank is on the bottom. The chain looks like regular bicycle chain. Are all the sprockets the same diameter? Why is there a spring near the center sprocket?

![image 2](/images/peetham_crank_system/02_gears_closeup.jpg)

---

Image 3 - View of main frame and entire route of the chain. The tie rods move up and down as they are turned by the chain and crank. There is mounting plate on the top of the wooden leg which has a nut embedded. The tie rod is threaded through this nut. As the tie rod turns the nut goes up and down relative to the rod. This nut is embedded in the leg and therefore as the tie rod turns the leg telescopes up or down.

Image 4 - Top view of platform, assembled. Hardware is hidden.

---

Image 6 - Bottom view of assembled platform, turned upside down for disassembly. Notice the crank for changing height of platform. The platform is transported as one piece.

Image 7 - Tie rod with nut and cotter pins. Tie rod has a groove for pins.

Image 11 - Set of parts for one leg -

1. Tie rod, stainless steel, 12 mm dia (recommend increase to 14 or 16 mm)
1. Machined nut
1. Cotter pins (2)
1. Nuts, unmodified (2)
1. Sprocket
1. Roller bearing
1. Mounting plate
1. Bushing, outer part
1. Bushing, inner part
1. T-shaped piece, flat

Image 12 - Tie rod with machined nut, cotter pins, and bushing consisting of 2 pieces

![image 12](/images/peetham_crank_system/12_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing.jpg)

---

Image 13 - Close up of tie rod and nut. The cotter pin goes into the groove on the tie rod and locks into the notch on the machined nut.

![image 13](/images/peetham_crank_system/13_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_2.jpg)

---

Image 14 - Close up of bushing. What is the blue component made of?

![image 14](/images/peetham_crank_system/14_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_3.jpg)

---

Image 15 - Mounting plate with embedded nut. This plate is where the tie rod assembly connects to the top of the telescoping leg.

![image 15](/images/peetham_crank_system/15_mounting_plate.jpg)

---

Image 16 - Other side of mounting plate with embedded nut

![image 16](/images/peetham_crank_system/16_mounting_plate_2.jpg)

---

Image 17 - This is where one of the tie rods emerges from the main frame. The sprockets, chain, and entire main frame stay together and move up or down as a unit. As the crank is turned and the tie rods also turn, the unmodified nut moves up or down the tie rod. This nut is embedded in the mounting plate and so is prevented from turning as the tie rod turns. As the tie rod moves up or down, it forces the leg to extend or retract. It appears there is another bearing embedded in the main frame where the tie rod emerges.

![image 17](/images/peetham_crank_system/17_lifting_site.jpg)

---

Image 18 - Lower tie rod assembly. Notice the slot in the top of the tie rod. The T-shaped piece (see image 11) fits into this slot and creates a strong connection to the sprocket.

![image 18](/images/peetham_crank_system/18_tie_rod_assembly.jpg)

---

Image 19 - Lower tie rod assembly. What is the purpose of the small piece of plywood above the nut?

![image 19](/images/peetham_crank_system/19_tie_rod_assembly_2.jpg)

---

Image 20 - Close up of upper tie rod, sprocket, bearing, bushing, and machined nut. The entire weight of the platform rests on these four sets of roller bearings, one on each leg. It seems that the bearing is firmly attached to the bushing, which in turn is firmly attached to the tie rod. When everything is assembled, the roller bearing is underneath the main frame, supporting the entire platform. There is (must be?) a raceway that accommodates the bearing where the tie rod comes through the main frame. This area is shown in image 17.

Image 21 - Close up of upper tie rod, bearing, bushing, and machined nut, assembled.

Image 23 - Leg assembly sitting next to main frame

![image 23](/images/peetham_crank_system/23_leg_in_context.jpg)

---

Image 24 - Another view of leg assembly sitting next to main frame. In this image, we can more clearly imagine there must be a raceway embedded in the main frame that accepts the roller bearing on the tie rod assembly

Apparently the partially assembled leg is inserted from underneath, and then the sprocket is installed on top. Then the T-shaped piece goes into the slot on top of the tie rod. Finally there is a nut that secures the sprocket to the top end of the tie rod.

#### Hydraulic Lifting System

Hydraulic lifting tables are available that are larger and can lift a thousand or more pounds. However, hydraulic systems are heavy. The lightest hydraulic system weighs about 350 lb and costs several thousand dollars.

The hydraulic systems are not recommended because of the high cost and the difficulty of moving the heavy systems around.
