## Transporting Tour Equipment

<summary><b> Suggested Transportation Strategy</b></summary>

---

Renting big trucks for a shorter tour is not recommended because it would cost too much and arrive too late. It seems better to follow the pattern of the fall tours to Michigan and California. Don't use the big trucks. Obtain most items locally or ship them ahead of time. Many important items can be quickly transported from Michigan to Elburn.

Only the most essential items should be transported from SR -

- Amma's chair
- Amma's peetham
- Chair cloth suitcase
- Other custom darshan equipment

Minivans are suggested for the time sensitive items because they are faster than larger cargo vans. Probably Amma's chair, peetham, and some smaller items can fit in one minivan. This would have to be the Dodge Caravan or Chrysler Pacifica with seats that fold down and disappear into the floor.

We could have multiple minivans or combination of minivan and cargo vans. It might be decided to use a truck for the sound system. Obviously any decisions about renting vehicles must go through the tour coordinators.

We need at least 2 drivers per minivan. Fortunately the drivers only need a normal drivers license, not a commercial license.

If requested, I can produce a break down of cost differences between truck, van, and minivan.

<summary><b>Summary of Projects</b></summary>

---

- New (?) smaller peetham with system for raising up automatically
- System for raising Amma's chair automatically like the turning mechanism in Amritapuri
- Arms of Amma's chair need to slide sideways - Hansa has the sliding armrests
- Table for in front of Amma that she beats with the stick during bhajans
- Table for gong for meditation
- Foam "things" of different weight to make the columns on both sides of peetham

Other projects that may be needed

- Ramps for standing darshan
- Rolling table with shelf for bhajan books
- New arm rests on Amma's chair should be removable

<summary><b>Modify Amma's Peetham</b></summary>

---

We need to modify Amma's peetham so that the height is adjustable from 12 inches to 17.5 inches

Lola says it may or may not be necessary to build a smaller peetham -

- Size of Amma's peetham in Amritapuri - 47 inches wide, 34 inches long
- Lola says to plan the project but expenses are not yet approved

If a new peetham is going to be made it should be built with hardware components from the west which is made for the purpose of lifting which would telescope the legs up and down.

<summary><b>Lifting Systems - Notes</b></summary>

---

It seems that very similar lifting systems are used for both Amma's peetham and chair at Amritapuri, right?

Probably our best option is to build lifting mechanisms similar to what they have in Amritapuri. This lifting system was built in India at least 16 years ago by Amma's son Jitendra, using hardware available in India. From what I understand, this is a successful system. It seems like if the chain breaks or comes off, there is no danger of sudden collapse. The platform would simply be stuck in the current position, right?

There is an idea for a hydraulic system operated with a remote, like in a hospital bed. But this is an unproven design. A potential problem with a hydraulic system, apart from the learning curve, is that the hydraulic fluid could leak, allowing the platform to lose height somewhat quickly.

Image 1 - Bottom view of leg

![image 1](/images/01_leg_side_view_.jpg)

---

Image 2 - Sprockets and chain drive. The crank is on the bottom. The chain looks like regular bicycle chain. Are all the sprockets the same diameter? Why is there a spring near the center sprocket?

![image 2](/images/02_gears_closeup.jpg)

---

Image 3 - View of main frame and entire route of the chain. The tie rods move up and down as they are turned by the chain and crank. There is mounting plate on the top of the wooden leg which has a nut embedded. The tie rod is threaded through this nut. As the tie rod turns the nut goes up and down relative to the rod. This nut is embedded in the leg and therefore as the tie rod turns the leg telescopes up or down.

Image 4 - Top view of platform, assembled. Hardware is hidden.

Image 5 - Main frame with top platform removed

![image 5](/images/05_platform_off.jpg)

---

Image 6 - Bottom view of assembled platform, turned upside down for disassembly. Notice the crank for changing height of platform. The platform is transported as one piece.

![image 6](/images/06_platform_on.jpg)

---

Image 7 - Tie rod with nut and cotter pins. Tie rod has a groove for pins.

![image 7](/images/07_tie_rod_w_nut.jpg)

---

Image 8 - Tie rod with nut and cotter pins, a bit closer

![image 8](/images/08_tie_rod_w_nut_2.jpg)

Image 9 - Custom machined nut

---

Image 10 - Custom machined nut, again

![image 10](/images/10_nut_closeup_2.jpg)

Image 11 - Set of parts for one leg -

1. Tie rod, stainless steel, 12 mm dia (recommend increase to 14 or 16 mm)
1. Machined nut
1. Cotter pins (2)
1. Nuts, unmodified (2)
1. Sprocket
1. Roller bearing
1. Mounting plate
1. Bushing, outer part
1. Bushing, inner part
1. T-shaped piece, flat

![image 11](/images/11_tie_rod_parts_list.jpg)

Image 12 - Tie rod with machined nut, cotter pins, and bushing consisting of 2 pieces

![image 12](/images/12_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing.jpg)

---

Image 13 - Close up of tie rod and nut. The cotter pin goes into the groove on the tie rod and locks into the notch on the machined nut.

![image 13](/images/13_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_2.jpg)

---

Image 14 - Close up of bushing. What is the blue component made of?

![image 14](/images/14_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_3.jpg)

---

Image 15 - Mounting plate with embedded nut. This plate is where the tie rod assembly connects to the top of the telescoping leg.

![image 15](/images/15_mounting_plate.jpg)

---

Image 16 - Other side of mounting plate with embedded nut

![image 16](/images/16_mounting_plate_2.jpg)

---

Image 17 - This is where one of the tie rods emerges from the main frame. The sprockets, chain, and entire main frame stay together and move up or down as a unit. As the crank is turned and the tie rods also turn, the unmodified nut moves up or down the tie rod. This nut is embedded in the mounting plate and so is prevented from turning as the tie rod turns. As the tie rod moves up or down, it forces the leg to extend or retract. It appears there is another bearing embedded in the main frame where the tie rod emerges.

![image 17](/images/17_mounting_site.jpg)

---

Image 18 - Lower tie rod assembly. Notice the slot in the top of the tie rod. The T-shaped piece (see image 11) fits into this slot and creates a strong connection to the sprocket.

![image 18](/images/18_tie_rod_assembly.jpg)

---

Image 19 - Lower tie rod assembly. What is the purpose of the small piece of plywood above the nut?

![image 19](/images/19_tie_rod_assembly_2.jpg)

---

Image 20 - Close up of upper tie rod, sprocket, bearing, bushing, and machined nut. The entire weight of the platform rests on these four sets of roller bearings, one on each leg. It seems that The bearing is firmly attached to the bushing, which in turn is firmly attached to the tie rod. When everything is assembled, the roller bearing is underneath the main frame, supporting the entire platform. There is (must be?) a raceway that accommodates the bearing where the tie rod comes through the main frame. This area is shown in image 17.

![image 20](/images/20_bearing_assembly.jpg)

---

Image 21 - Close up of upper tie rod, bearing, bushing, and machined nut, assembled.

![image 21](/images/21_bearing_closeup.jpg)

---

Image 22 - One complete leg assembly

![image 22](/images/22_assembled_leg.jpg)

---

Image 23 - Leg assembly sitting next to main frame

![image 23](/images/23_leg_in_context.jpg)

---

Image 24 - Another view of leg assembly sitting next to main frame. In this image, we can more clearly imagine there must be a raceway embedded in the main frame that accepts the roller bearing on the tie rod assembly

Apparently the partially assembled leg is inserted from underneath, and then the sprocket is installed on top. Then the T-shaped piece goes into the slot on top of the tie rod. Finally there is a nut that secures the sprocket to the top end of the tie rod.
