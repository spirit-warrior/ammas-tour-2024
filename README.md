#### Lifting system for Amma's chair

Amma's chair will use the same lifting columns as for the peetham

- DHLCE-270A

#### Adjustable arm rests for Amma's chair

- Modify chair so that height of arm rest is adjustable
- Modify padding on the back of the arm rest so that an elastic band can go over the arm rest to hold chair cloth in place

#### Replace the strings that hold the back cushion

- Use strings like the ones on the Michigan chair

#### Notes from Paul

- Surface of peetham and chair - 3/4" plywood
- Base of peetham and chair - 3/4" plywood

- New chair would have a plywood seat and a frame that wrapped around the plywood, covering the edge.
- The frame extends below the plywood, providing a hiding place for controller and power supply.
- Mount the lifting columns as close as possible to edge of platform
- Corners of the frame should be miter cut and glued
- No screws are visible
- Round all exposed edges with a router.
- The design should not impede Amma from swinging her feet under the chair.
- Optional - backrest and armrests are removable for easier transport

<summary><b>Standing Darshan Ramps</b></summary>

---

Warning - These calculations are only valid if stage height is 36 inches

Calculate height of raised platform

- Typical stage height, N. American tour - 36 inches
- Distance of raised platform below stage - 20.75 inches
- 36 - 20.75 = 15.25
- Typical height of raised platform - 15.25 inches

Calculate length of ramp -

- Height of raised platform - 15.25 inches
- Slope - 1:12
- 15.25 x 12 = 183 inches aka 15 feet 3 inches
- Length of ramp - at least 15.25 feet

Virtually all venues in US must comply with ADA requirements (Americans with Disabilities Act). For ADA compliance, the slope for a wheelchair ramp must be no greater than 1:12 (one inch of rise for every 12 inches of ramp length).

Raised platform

- Width - 77 inches
- Front to back - 49.5 inches
- Height - 20.75 inches lower than the stage

Dimensions of ramps

- Width
  - Center ramp - 77 inches
  - Side ramps - 49.5 inches
- Length - 15.25 feet
- Height at high end - 15.25 inches
- Slope - 1:12 or 8.33%

Planks - I don't get this

For standing darshan, there need to be large planks to bring the people higher/closer to Amma as needed

- 4 planks 30L x 25W x 2 height (inches)
- 2 planks 30L x 25W x 1 height (inches)
- covered with cheap carpet

<summary><b>Prasad Table</b></summary>

---

- 22 inches long x 12 inches wide
- Height
  - Adjustable from 22 to 27 inches
  - can be adjusted during darshan
  - May not need to go as low as 22 inches

An important feature of our prasad table in N. America is that magnets are embedded in the top surface. These magnets hold the prasad tray and sandalwood paste container from sliding around. The magnets can be embedded in the new prasad table after it is built.

Photos of embedded magnets coming (not very) soon!

![image ptA](/images/prasad_table/prasad_table_A_side.jpg)

Notice there is a silver knob that is turned by hand to lower and raise the table. It has a latch to hold it at selected position.

#### Prasad table side piece

- Hinged and attached at bottom (?)
- Length - 18 inches
- Height - 8 inches

We are requested to have this side piece on the new prasad table. When the side piece is folded out, it "serves as a barrier for the prasad area".

However, I think it isn't helpful for our prasad area. We have never needed it before and it will just be in the way. We won't be able to easily fold it in or out because folding will be blocked by the prasad people sitting on chairs.

About Vertical Side Cushions

- Purpose - to fill the space between the inside of the chair arms
- One on each side
- Shaped like upside down "L"
- Length "Not to exceed 8 inches from front of the chair to 2 inches from the back of the chair seat"
- Length needs to be adjusted to match Amma's North America chair, probably 12 to 14 inches
- Length - 14 inches per Chaitanyan
- Height - "will need to be measured with the seat and back cushions in place".
- Doesn't height depend on height of arm rests which are supposed to be adjustable?

Vertical Side Cushion A

- Thickness - 1 inch
- Length - 14 inches
- Height - needs to be decided
- Quantity needed - 4? 2? they come in sets, one for each side? Do they want 2 sets, 4 cushions? not clear

Vertical Side Cushion B

- Thickness - 2 inch
- Length - 14 inches
- Height - needs to be decided
- Quantity needed - 2 cushions? or 2 sets? Probably 1 set of 2 cushions, one for each side? not clear

## Photo Archives - Lifting Systems

<details>
<summary><b>Mechanical Lifting System - Amritapuri</b></summary>

---

This lifting system was built in India around 2007 by Amma's son Jitendra, using hardware obtained in India.

Amma's chair in Amritapuri also has a similar lifting system but no photos could be provided because the mechanisms are hidden inside the woodwork of the chair.

Image 2 - Sprockets and chain drive. The crank is on the bottom. The chain looks like regular bicycle chain. Are all the sprockets the same diameter? Why is there a spring near the center sprocket?

![image 2](/images/peetham_crank_system/02_gears_closeup.jpg)

---

Image 3 - View of main frame and entire route of the chain. The tie rods move up and down as they are turned by the chain and crank. There is mounting plate on the top of the wooden leg which has a nut embedded. The tie rod is threaded through this nut. As the tie rod turns the nut goes up and down relative to the rod. This nut is embedded in the leg and therefore as the tie rod turns the leg telescopes up or down.

![image 3](/images/peetham_crank_system/03_chain_overview.jpg)

---

Image 4 - Top view of platform, assembled. Hardware is hidden.

![image 4](/images/peetham_crank_system/04_platform_w_carpet.jpg)

---

Image 5 - Main frame with top platform removed

![image 5](/images/peetham_crank_system/05_platform_off.jpg)

---

Image 6 - Bottom view of assembled platform, turned upside down for disassembly. Notice the crank for changing height of platform. The platform is transported as one piece.

![image 6](/images/peetham_crank_system/06_platform_on.jpg)

---

Image 7 - Tie rod with nut and cotter pins. Tie rod has a groove for pins.

![image 7](/images/peetham_crank_system/07_tie_rod_w_nut.jpg)

---

Image 8 - Tie rod with nut and cotter pins, a bit closer

![image 8](/images/peetham_crank_system/08_tie_rod_w_nut_2.jpg)

Image 10 - Custom machined nut, again

![image 10](/images/peetham_crank_system/10_nut_closeup_2.jpg)

Image 11 - Set of parts for one leg -

1. Tie rod, stainless steel, 12 mm dia (recommend increase to 14 or 16 mm)
1. Machined nut
1. Cotter pins (2)
1. Nuts, unmodified (2)
1. Sprocket
1. Roller bearing
1. Mounting plate
1. Bushing, outer part
1. Bushing, inner part
1. T-shaped piece, flat

![image 11](/images/peetham_crank_system/11_tie_rod_parts_list.jpg)

---

Image 12 - Tie rod with machined nut, cotter pins, and bushing consisting of 2 pieces

![image 12](/images/peetham_crank_system/12_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing.jpg)

---

Image 13 - Close up of tie rod and nut. The cotter pin goes into the groove on the tie rod and locks into the notch on the machined nut.

![image 13](/images/peetham_crank_system/13_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_2.jpg)

---

Image 14 - Close up of bushing. What is the blue component made of?

![image 14](/images/peetham_crank_system/14_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_3.jpg)

---

Image 15 - Mounting plate with embedded nut. This plate is where the tie rod assembly connects to the top of the telescoping leg.

![image 15](/images/peetham_crank_system/15_mounting_plate.jpg)

---

Image 16 - Other side of mounting plate with embedded nut

![image 16](/images/peetham_crank_system/16_mounting_plate_2.jpg)

---

Image 17 - This is where one of the tie rods emerges from the main frame. The sprockets, chain, and entire main frame stay together and move up or down as a unit. As the crank is turned and the tie rods also turn, the unmodified nut moves up or down the tie rod. This nut is embedded in the mounting plate and so is prevented from turning as the tie rod turns. As the tie rod moves up or down, it forces the leg to extend or retract. It appears there is another bearing embedded in the main frame where the tie rod emerges.

![image 17](/images/peetham_crank_system/17_lifting_site.jpg)

---

Image 18 - Lower tie rod assembly. Notice the slot in the top of the tie rod. The T-shaped piece (see image 11) fits into this slot and creates a strong connection to the sprocket.

![image 18](/images/peetham_crank_system/18_tie_rod_assembly.jpg)

---

Image 19 - Lower tie rod assembly. What is the purpose of the small piece of plywood above the nut?

![image 19](/images/peetham_crank_system/19_tie_rod_assembly_2.jpg)

---

Image 20 - Close up of upper tie rod, sprocket, bearing, bushing, and machined nut. The entire weight of the platform rests on these four sets of roller bearings, one on each leg. It seems that the bearing is firmly attached to the bushing, which in turn is firmly attached to the tie rod. When everything is assembled, the roller bearing is underneath the main frame, supporting the entire platform. There is (must be?) a raceway that accommodates the bearing where the tie rod comes through the main frame. This area is shown in image 17.

![image 20](/images/peetham_crank_system/20_bearing_assembly.jpg)

---

Image 21 - Close up of upper tie rod, bearing, bushing, and machined nut, assembled.

![image 21](/images/peetham_crank_system/21_bearing_closeup.jpg)

Image 22 - One complete leg assembly

Image 23 - Leg assembly sitting next to main frame

![image 23](/images/peetham_crank_system/23_leg_in_context.jpg)

---

Image 24 - Another view of leg assembly sitting next to main frame. In this image, we can more clearly imagine there must be a raceway embedded in the main frame that accepts the roller bearing on the tie rod assembly

Apparently the partially assembled leg is inserted from underneath, and then the sprocket is installed on top. Then the T-shaped piece goes into the slot on top of the tie rod. Finally there is a nut that secures the sprocket to the top end of the tie rod.

#### Hydraulic Lifting System

Hydraulic lifting tables are available that are larger and can lift a thousand or more pounds. However, hydraulic systems are heavy. The lightest hydraulic system weighs about 350 lb and costs several thousand dollars.

The hydraulic systems are not recommended because of the high cost and the difficulty of moving the heavy systems around.
