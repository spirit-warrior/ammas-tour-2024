<!-- Created this repo - March 31, 2024 -->

The announcement has gone out that Amma is coming to North America in July 2024. The plan is to go to all the cities, same as before, except not Dallas. The order of cities is yet to be determined. The intention is to start the tour on July 1st and run into the middle of August. There will be retreats but no other details have been released.

## Lifting Systems for Peetham and Chair

<table>

<details>
<summary><b>Proposed New Adjustable Peetham</b></summary>

---

We are requested to build a smaller peetham with the following dimensions:

- Width, side-to-side - 47 inches
- Length, front-to-back - 34 inches
- Thickness of peetham platform (not including unistrut lifting system) - No estimate yet
- Total height - Adjustable from 12 inches to 17.5 inches.

Height of peetham should be adjustable to anywhere within the range, rather than at certain "stops".

Currently we are considering using actuators to raise and lower the peetham. This seems preferable to the other options: hydraulics or mechanical crank and gear systems (see photos in archives).

Amma's attendants request that the height of the peetham should be adjustable using a remote. Further they request extra remotes (4 for each lifting system) so that hopefully not all of them get lost or misplaced.

One suggestion (for an easier design and build) is that the peetham might move forward or backward a few inches when it is raised or lowered. There is no official approval or disapproval of this idea, but approval seems unlikely.

The actuators may be noisy but we don't yet know how noisy. It may be possible to muffle the noise.

<summary><b>Proposed Lifting System for Amma's Chair</b></summary>

---

We need the same type of lifting system for adjusting the height of Amma's chair during darshan. It would probably be much the same as the system for the peetham as described above.

The height and other specifications will be posted here soon.

<summary><b>Archives - Photos of Mechanical Lifting System - Amritapuri</b></summary>

---

This lifting system was built in India around 2007 by Amma's son Jitendra, using hardware obtained in India.

Amma's chair in Amritapuri also has a similar lifting system but no photos could be provided because the mechanisms are hidden inside the woodwork of the chair.

Image 2 - Sprockets and chain drive. The crank is on the bottom. The chain looks like regular bicycle chain. Are all the sprockets the same diameter? Why is there a spring near the center sprocket?

---

Image 3 - View of main frame and entire route of the chain. The tie rods move up and down as they are turned by the chain and crank. There is mounting plate on the top of the wooden leg which has a nut embedded. The tie rod is threaded through this nut. As the tie rod turns the nut goes up and down relative to the rod. This nut is embedded in the leg and therefore as the tie rod turns the leg telescopes up or down.

Image 4 - Top view of platform, assembled. Hardware is hidden.

Image 6 - Bottom view of assembled platform, turned upside down for disassembly. Notice the crank for changing height of platform. The platform is transported as one piece.

Image 7 - Tie rod with nut and cotter pins. Tie rod has a groove for pins.

Image 11 - Set of parts for one leg -

1. Tie rod, stainless steel, 12 mm dia (recommend increase to 14 or 16 mm)
1. Machined nut
1. Cotter pins (2)
1. Nuts, unmodified (2)
1. Sprocket
1. Roller bearing
1. Mounting plate
1. Bushing, outer part
1. Bushing, inner part
1. T-shaped piece, flat

Image 12 - Tie rod with machined nut, cotter pins, and bushing consisting of 2 pieces

![image 12](/images/12_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing.jpg)

---

Image 13 - Close up of tie rod and nut. The cotter pin goes into the groove on the tie rod and locks into the notch on the machined nut.

![image 13](/images/13_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_2.jpg)

---

Image 14 - Close up of bushing. What is the blue component made of?

![image 14](/images/14_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_3.jpg)

---

Image 15 - Mounting plate with embedded nut. This plate is where the tie rod assembly connects to the top of the telescoping leg.

![image 15](/images/15_mounting_plate.jpg)

---

Image 16 - Other side of mounting plate with embedded nut

![image 16](/images/16_mounting_plate_2.jpg)

---

Image 17 - This is where one of the tie rods emerges from the main frame. The sprockets, chain, and entire main frame stay together and move up or down as a unit. As the crank is turned and the tie rods also turn, the unmodified nut moves up or down the tie rod. This nut is embedded in the mounting plate and so is prevented from turning as the tie rod turns. As the tie rod moves up or down, it forces the leg to extend or retract. It appears there is another bearing embedded in the main frame where the tie rod emerges.

![image 17](/images/17_lifting_site.jpg)

---

Image 18 - Lower tie rod assembly. Notice the slot in the top of the tie rod. The T-shaped piece (see image 11) fits into this slot and creates a strong connection to the sprocket.

![image 18](/images/18_tie_rod_assembly.jpg)

---

Image 19 - Lower tie rod assembly. What is the purpose of the small piece of plywood above the nut?

![image 19](/images/19_tie_rod_assembly_2.jpg)

---

Image 20 - Close up of upper tie rod, sprocket, bearing, bushing, and machined nut. The entire weight of the platform rests on these four sets of roller bearings, one on each leg. It seems that the bearing is firmly attached to the bushing, which in turn is firmly attached to the tie rod. When everything is assembled, the roller bearing is underneath the main frame, supporting the entire platform. There is (must be?) a raceway that accommodates the bearing where the tie rod comes through the main frame. This area is shown in image 17.

Image 21 - Close up of upper tie rod, bearing, bushing, and machined nut, assembled.

Image 22 - One complete leg assembly

Image 23 - Leg assembly sitting next to main frame

![image 23](/images/23_leg_in_context.jpg)

---

Image 24 - Another view of leg assembly sitting next to main frame. In this image, we can more clearly imagine there must be a raceway embedded in the main frame that accepts the roller bearing on the tie rod assembly

Apparently the partially assembled leg is inserted from underneath, and then the sprocket is installed on top. Then the T-shaped piece goes into the slot on top of the tie rod. Finally there is a nut that secures the sprocket to the top end of the tie rod.
