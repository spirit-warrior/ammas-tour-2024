<!-- Created this repo - March 31, 2024 -->

It's official. Amma is coming to North America in July 2024. The plan is to go to all the cities, same as before, except not Dallas and not Atlanta. The order of cities is yet to be determined. The intention is to start the tour on July 1st and run into the middle of August. There will be retreats but no other details have been released.

## Changes to Peetham and Chair

<details>
<summary><b>New Peetham - Specs</b></summary>

---

The new peetham should meet the following specifications:

- Width, side-to-side - 50 inches
- Length, front-to-back - 35 inches
- Thickness of peetham platform (not including unistrut lifting system) - No estimate yet
- Total height - Adjustable from 12 inches to 19 inches.
- Height of peetham should be adjustable to anywhere within the range, rather than only at certain "stops".
- If system relies on a remote, there should extra remotes (4 for each lifting system) because we need absolute reliability

We are considering using actuators to raise and lower the peetham.

- [Link to electric lifting platform on Ebay - Select Model for 150 kg](https://www.ebay.com/itm/235250797536)

  - Minimum height of electric platform - 8"
  - Maximum height of electric platform - 26"
  - Base of electric platform is 16" by 29". So we would have to screw it to a wider base board to provide stability.
  - It lifts 150 kilograms or 330 lb. However it may be impossible to control the number of kids that climb on.
  - The weight should probably be more or less centered on the platform rather than all on one edge
  - Given the minimum height of the electric platform (8 inches), the thickness of the peetham platform (attached on top) should not exceed 4 inches so that we meet requirement for total height in lowered position of 12 inches.
  - There are three ways to adjust the height -
    - A wired switch
    - Using wifi and smartphone app
    - Remote control - We can probably buy extra remotes

The actuator lifting system used in Thailand is shown later in this doc -

So far, the only alternative to actuator system is a mechanical crank and gear system as shown later in this doc -

<summary><b>Lifting System for Amma's Chair</b></summary>

---

We need a similar lifting system for adjusting the height of Amma's chair during darshan. If possible, it should be much the same as the system for the peetham.

The height and other specifications will be posted here soon. The space under the chair is differs greatly from the space under the peetham. So the design may need to be quite different.

<summary><b>Mechanical Lifting System - Amritapuri</b></summary>

---

This lifting system was built in India around 2007 by Amma's son Jitendra, using hardware obtained in India.

Amma's chair in Amritapuri also has a similar lifting system but no photos could be provided because the mechanisms are hidden inside the woodwork of the chair.

Image 2 - Sprockets and chain drive. The crank is on the bottom. The chain looks like regular bicycle chain. Are all the sprockets the same diameter? Why is there a spring near the center sprocket?

![image 2](/images/peetham_crank_system/02_gears_closeup.jpg)

---

Image 3 - View of main frame and entire route of the chain. The tie rods move up and down as they are turned by the chain and crank. There is mounting plate on the top of the wooden leg which has a nut embedded. The tie rod is threaded through this nut. As the tie rod turns the nut goes up and down relative to the rod. This nut is embedded in the leg and therefore as the tie rod turns the leg telescopes up or down.

![image 3](/images/peetham_crank_system/03_chain_overview.jpg)

---

Image 4 - Top view of platform, assembled. Hardware is hidden.

Image 5 - Main frame with top platform removed

![image 5](/images/peetham_crank_system/05_platform_off.jpg)

---

Image 6 - Bottom view of assembled platform, turned upside down for disassembly. Notice the crank for changing height of platform. The platform is transported as one piece.

![image 6](/images/peetham_crank_system/06_platform_on.jpg)

---

Image 8 - Tie rod with nut and cotter pins, a bit closer

![image 8](/images/peetham_crank_system/08_tie_rod_w_nut_2.jpg)

Image 9 - Custom machined nut

![image 9](/images/peetham_crank_system/09_nut_closeup.jpg)

---

Image 10 - Custom machined nut, again

![image 10](/images/peetham_crank_system/10_nut_closeup_2.jpg)

---

Image 11 - Set of parts for one leg -

1. Tie rod, stainless steel, 12 mm dia (recommend increase to 14 or 16 mm)
1. Machined nut
1. Cotter pins (2)
1. Nuts, unmodified (2)
1. Sprocket
1. Roller bearing
1. Mounting plate
1. Bushing, outer part
1. Bushing, inner part
1. T-shaped piece, flat

![image 11](/images/peetham_crank_system/11_tie_rod_parts_list.jpg)

---

Image 12 - Tie rod with machined nut, cotter pins, and bushing consisting of 2 pieces

![image 12](/images/peetham_crank_system/12_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing.jpg)

---

Image 13 - Close up of tie rod and nut. The cotter pin goes into the groove on the tie rod and locks into the notch on the machined nut.

![image 13](/images/peetham_crank_system/13_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_2.jpg)

---

Image 14 - Close up of bushing. What is the blue component made of?

![image 14](/images/peetham_crank_system/14_tie_rod_w_blue_bushing_3.jpg)

---

Image 15 - Mounting plate with embedded nut. This plate is where the tie rod assembly connects to the top of the telescoping leg.

![image 15](/images/peetham_crank_system/15_mounting_plate.jpg)

---

Image 16 - Other side of mounting plate with embedded nut

![image 16](/images/peetham_crank_system/16_mounting_plate_2.jpg)

---

Image 17 - This is where one of the tie rods emerges from the main frame. The sprockets, chain, and entire main frame stay together and move up or down as a unit. As the crank is turned and the tie rods also turn, the unmodified nut moves up or down the tie rod. This nut is embedded in the mounting plate and so is prevented from turning as the tie rod turns. As the tie rod moves up or down, it forces the leg to extend or retract. It appears there is another bearing embedded in the main frame where the tie rod emerges.

![image 17](/images/peetham_crank_system/17_lifting_site.jpg)

---

Image 18 - Lower tie rod assembly. Notice the slot in the top of the tie rod. The T-shaped piece (see image 11) fits into this slot and creates a strong connection to the sprocket.

![image 18](/images/peetham_crank_system/18_tie_rod_assembly.jpg)

---

Image 19 - Lower tie rod assembly. What is the purpose of the small piece of plywood above the nut?

![image 19](/images/peetham_crank_system/19_tie_rod_assembly_2.jpg)

---

Image 20 - Close up of upper tie rod, sprocket, bearing, bushing, and machined nut. The entire weight of the platform rests on these four sets of roller bearings, one on each leg. It seems that the bearing is firmly attached to the bushing, which in turn is firmly attached to the tie rod. When everything is assembled, the roller bearing is underneath the main frame, supporting the entire platform. There is (must be?) a raceway that accommodates the bearing where the tie rod comes through the main frame. This area is shown in image 17.

![image 20](/images/peetham_crank_system/20_bearing_assembly.jpg)

---

Image 21 - Close up of upper tie rod, bearing, bushing, and machined nut, assembled.

![image 21](/images/peetham_crank_system/21_bearing_closeup.jpg)

Image 23 - Leg assembly sitting next to main frame

![image 23](/images/peetham_crank_system/23_leg_in_context.jpg)

---

Image 24 - Another view of leg assembly sitting next to main frame. In this image, we can more clearly imagine there must be a raceway embedded in the main frame that accepts the roller bearing on the tie rod assembly

Apparently the partially assembled leg is inserted from underneath, and then the sprocket is installed on top. Then the T-shaped piece goes into the slot on top of the tie rod. Finally there is a nut that secures the sprocket to the top end of the tie rod.

<summary><b>Prasad Table</b></summary>

---

- Dimensions - to be determined
- should have system for adjusting height during darshan
- should have a range of adjustment that matches the changing height of the chair
- More specifically, height of prasad table should be adjustable so that the top of the table can be adjusted to be even with the top of arm rest of Amma's chair

<summary><b>Bhajan table</b></summary>

---

This is the table that Amma beats with a stick during bhajans.

- The top surface is hardwood to withstand beatings from stick
- The top surface has a groove for the stick so it won't roll away
- 12.5 x 22 x 25.5 inches high
- Height includes the wheels

<summary><b>Clock table</b></summary>

---

- Dimensions - ???
- is on wheels

![image bt1](/images/clock_table_1.jpg)

---

Notice the small lamp attached to the table with a clip. During mediation when the lights are dim, the light shines on the clock, allowing Amma to see the time.

Why do we need a separate clock table?

Instead we could set the clock on the bhajan table during meditation. For illumination, we could have one or more small LED lights that are velcroed to the top of the clock. Or maybe we can find a clock with an illuminated face.
